        paragraph: "BG Unified Solutions worked together with our in-house engineers, whom we engaged to redesign our network. Saurabh was the engineer in-charge, who designed the whole solution to reduce the overall complexity and remove bottlenecks. He worked cohesively with our in-house team and brought great technical skills & expertise on Cisco switches, routers, firewalls, content switches, IPS etc. Throughout the project, his dedication was remarkable. He ensured that project is completed with minimum end-user impact and since all the implementations were performed in middle of night, he made himself personally available for mid-night implementations and any post-implementation support. Would highly recommend their skills, expertise and professional services.",
